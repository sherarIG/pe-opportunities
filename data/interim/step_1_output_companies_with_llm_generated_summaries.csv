Nakisa,www.nakisa.com,"There is **no publicly available, detailed funding history** for Nakisa, nor is there clear information on its current ownership structure in the provided search results or on its official website. Nakisa appears to be a **privately held company** specializing in workplace management and HR software solutions, but specifics about investors, venture capital involvement, or ownership breakdown are not disclosed in the accessible sources[https://nakisa.com/story-types/videos/][https://nakisa.com/blog/nakisa-workforce-planning-org-design-org-chart-software-2025-r2-product-release/][https://www.softwareworld.co/software/nakisa-iwms-reviews/].

**Key points from available information:**

- **Company Type:** Nakisa is consistently described as a private company, with no indication of being publicly traded or having undergone recent IPO activity[https://nakisa.com/story-types/videos/][https://nakisa.com/blog/nakisa-workforce-planning-org-design-org-chart-software-2025-r2-product-release/][https://www.softwareworld.co/software/nakisa-iwms-reviews/].
- **Funding History:** There are no records of venture capital rounds, private equity investments, or major funding announcements in the search results or on Nakisa’s public-facing materials.
- **Ownership Structure:** The company does not publish details about its shareholders, founders’ equity, or board composition. There is no mention of institutional investors or majority stakeholders in the available information.
- **Leadership:** While not directly related to ownership, Nakisa’s leadership and management team are referenced in product releases and customer stories, but without details on equity or ownership[https://nakisa.com/story-types/videos/][https://nakisa.com/blog/nakisa-workforce-planning-org-design-org-chart-software-2025-r2-product-release/].

**Inference:**  
Given the absence of funding disclosures and the company’s long-standing presence in the enterprise software market, it is likely that Nakisa is **founder-owned or closely held by a small group of private investors**. This is typical for established, privately held Canadian software companies that have not taken on significant outside investment or gone public. However, this is an inference and not directly confirmed by the sources.

If you require precise ownership or funding details (such as cap table, investor names, or funding rounds), you may need to contact Nakisa directly or consult business intelligence databases that track private company financials, as this information is not publicly disclosed in the sources provided.",https://nakisa.com/story-types/videos/ | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzX1mM05_V4 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rL5wUxl2QoE | https://nakisa.com/blog/nakisa-workforce-planning-org-design-org-chart-software-2025-r2-product-release/ | https://www.softwareworld.co/software/nakisa-iwms-reviews/
