**Next steps and recommendations:**

- If you are seeking information about a specific company named Morgen at www.morgenbt.com, it is possible that the company is either very new, operates under a different legal name, or has limited public presence.
- For the most accurate and up-to-date information, visit the company’s official website and look for sections such as ""About Us,"" ""Leadership,"" ""Team,"" or ""Investors."" If these are not available, consider reaching out to the company directly via their contact information.
- If you have alternative spellings or additional context (such as a city, country, or product name), providing those details may help refine the search.

### Funding History and Ownership Structure
- **Funding:** There is no public record of venture capital or institutional funding. CapitalSoft is described as a **private company**[https://www.salary.com/research/company/capitalsoft-inc-overview], and no recent funding rounds are reported in business databases[https://www.zoominfo.com/c/capitalsoft-inc/9028712][https://www.salary.com/research/company/capitalsoft-inc-overview].
- **Ownership:** The company remains privately owned. There is no evidence of majority acquisition by an outside entity.

Given the company’s small size, it is likely managed directly by its executive team.
- **Leadership Team:** The official website does not list a leadership or team section[https://www.capitalsoft.com]. External sources and recent press releases identify:
    - **Vic Cizmarik – President**[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/laru-technologies-acquired-by-capitalsoft-inc-joining-forces-for-ebpiq-venture-302455443.html]
